## Challenge Notes
This is my first project with tailwindcss and first project in a long time to actually coding something. So I had to update some necessary packages on my macbook.

![Downloading Necessary Packages](./readme-assets/CleanShot%202022-12-13%20at%2008.44.59%402x.png)

Just kidding, it only took a few minutes, but that's what it initially gave me as a time.

After all the downloading and updating, I finally started the project. Read the [tailwindcss get-started documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation). 

After a few minutes of banging my head on getting confused with Tailwindcss Documentation, I decided to watch YouTube of a quick [Tailwind Crash Course by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ). What resonated with his statement, "anything you want to do within css just about anything you can do with just tailwind classes" which clicked with me that I just need to have patience to learn what each of these classes and I don't have to write any css whatsoever. 

About 30 minutes later, I had the challenge completed.
